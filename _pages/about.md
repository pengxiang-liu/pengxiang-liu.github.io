Hey! My name is Pengxiang Liu. Welcome to my homepage! Thank you for your interest about me! I hope you can find something useful  here. I will be very happy if my research could spark some new ideas for you. In case you found my expertise interesting, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email :wink:

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Zijun Zhang](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/00308048.htm). My research interests include machine learning, optimization, and their applications in urban energy systems. Based in CityUHK, we have developed several powerful tools for constructing the digital twin of urban carbon/energy flow, and we are working on implementing the cutting-edge AI technology for the sustainable development of cities in the future.

Earlier, I received my M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from Southeast University under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Gu](https://ee.seu.edu.cn/2021/0331/c25248a366894/page.psp) and [Prof. Zhi Wu](https://ee.seu.edu.cn/wz/list.htm) in 2019 and 2023. From 2022 to 2023, I was a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK, supervised by [Prof. Goran Strbac](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.strbac). For more information, please refer to my [CV]().
